/* 
    CSS Height/Width
    Note: Remember that the height and width properties do not include padding, borders, or margins! They set the height/width of the area inside the padding, border, and margin of the element!

    CSS Display
    Every HTML element has a default display value depending on what type of element it is. The default display value for most elements is block or inline.

    CSS links
    When setting styles for several links, there are some orders to be followed
    a:link, a:visited, a:hover, a:active

    CSS Inline-block
    Compared to display: inline, the major difference is that display: inline-block allows to set a width and height on the element.
